Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

##Overview

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. A full description of the data used in this project is available at The UCI Machine Learning Repository:   

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 
   
[The source data for this project](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
   
The final data set saved in the averages.txt file, which can be read into R with read.table("tidyMeans.txt", header = TRUE). A detailed description of the variables can be found in CodeBook.md.

##Prerequisites
   
* All source files must be unzipped into "UCI_HAR_Dataset" folder in working directory.
* Script run_analysis.R uses package "dplyr" (Hadley Wickham and Romain Francois (2015). dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation. R package version 0.4.2. http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr). You can install the package from cran directory with command "install.packages("dplyr")".
